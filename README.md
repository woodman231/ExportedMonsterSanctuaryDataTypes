# Exported Monster Sanctuary Data Types
This repository is simply the results of executing the [ExportedMonsterSanctuaryDataTypesGenerator package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@woodman231/exportedmonstersanctuarydatatypesgenerator) which analyzes the data from the [ExportedMonsterSanctuaryData package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@woodman231/exportedmonstersanctuarydata) which the data is generated from this BepInEx [plugin](https://github.com/woodman231/AddAndExportAllMonsters).

This should make it so that an IDE can get some intellisense about data types of the exported data. This package will usually be installed with the ExportedMonsterSanctuaryData package for TypeScript developed applications.
